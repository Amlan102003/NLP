The aim of this project is to build a Tensorflow based spam detector which can classify emails as Spam/Non Spam.
Implemented various Natural Language Processing techniques such as Word2vec model, Tokenization, Stopwords removal, Punctuations removal and several other text pre-processing
techniques.The model also includes a LSTM layer and a dense layer .
Test accuracy of the model is 97.5%.
