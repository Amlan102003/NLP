The aim of this project is to build a Tensorflow based spam detector which can classify emails as Spam/Non Spam.
Implemented various Natural Language Processing techniques such as Word2vec model, Tokenization, Stopwords removal, Punctuations removal and several other text pre-processing
techniques.The model also includes a LSTM layer and a dense layer .
We also used Word Cloud- A Text visualisation Tool that helps us to get insights of the most frequent words present in the corpus of data.
Test accuracy of the model is 97.5%.
